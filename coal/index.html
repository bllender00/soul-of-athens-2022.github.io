Coal is widespread in Southeast Ohio. Mined and unmined, the history of coal is vast. Before humans began the coal industry that was integral in settling the coal towns that defined the region for generations, glaciers roamed. As they moved south, carving the farmland of Ohio, they collected sediment and eventually deposited it in Southeast Ohio. The Appalachian foothills were created, along with the coal that made the industrial revolution possible. </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-in">Nowhere is this more apparent than in Perry County, the number one producer of coal in Ohio in the late 1870s and early 1880s, according to Chris Wilson. Wilson, a native of Shawnee, Ohio, currently works alongside Sherryl Blosser at the Little Cities of Black Diamonds council (LCBD), a non-profit formed in 1990 dedicated to teaching and preserving knowledge about the former mining towns in Southeast Ohio.  </p><p data-aos="fade-in">Mining began small scale and personal. Miners during the first few years of the 19th century had only small-scale mines. Digging out what they could from their own personal mines and taking only what they needed to sustain themselves and the immediate community.  </p>
		<p data-aos="fade-in">Mining towns began forming after the American Civil War with the rise of railroads. Union Colonel James Taylor, who LCBD credits with discovering the coal fields in Perry County, took advantage of the railroads and began opening mines to ship and sell coal to companies in quickly developing cities like Chicago, Illinois.  </p>

	<p data-aos="fade-in" >Most competition between towns was before World War One when each mine had one nationality of workers. They were pitted against each other by mine owners, which was not especially difficult because of the turmoil that already existed between many of the nationalities. Irish Catholics, for example, did not get along with protestants or Germans so they remained separate until it was dangerous to for Germans in America because of World War One, according to Sherryl Blosser. The tactic of separation was to keep mine workers from forming a stronger labor union, which failed and labor groups like UMW unified miners against their oppressors. </p>
	<p data-aos="fade-in" >After World War Two, the mining industry turned from manpower to machine power. Just as the railroads had done nearly a century earlier, machines that could mine more coal faster took over the coal industry. Along with the new technology, companies also sought better sources of coal. Coal deposits in West Virginia were of better quality and abundantly available compared to the coal in Southeast Ohio and soon mining companies moved south. The industry not only left Southeast Ohioans jobless, but the industry left the land scarred. </p>

The interaction between metals and oxygen turns the water orange and poisonous to drink. Organizations like Rural Action have been treating acid mine drainage in many ways, so water quality in former mining towns has steadily improved. Since partnering with John Sabraw, an artist and professor at Ohio University who has been developing pigments to use in paint from the AMD, newspapers and magazines across the United States have been covering the efforts to fight AMD in Southeast Ohio, but poisonous water is not the legacy of coal.</p>
